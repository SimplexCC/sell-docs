# send-crypto #

A request, from Simplex, for you to send crypto currency to a specified destination crypto address.

If you are the entity providing liquidity for a Simplex transaction, then after Simplex approves the transaction you will be asked to create a blockchain transaction that will result in the transfer of a specified amount of crypto currency to a specified destination crypto address.

In case of a refund, if you are the entity that received the crypto currency you will be asked to send it "back" (albeit to a possibly different crypto address from which it was sent).

This request from Simplex results in a you creating an execution order ("xo"), for which you generate an identifier. Your response includes an identifier for this execution order, together with its status:
 * completed: you successfullly fulfilled the execution order by creating a blockchain transaction
 * failed: there was an error creating the blockchain transaction
 * pending: you have not yet created the blockchain transaction, but will do so soon

In all cases your response must include an execution order identifier, which Simplex can use to query you (your API) about its status; whether or not a blockchain transaction has been created to fulfill the execution order is the meaning of `status`.

## Synopsis ##

API name: **`send-crypto`**  
Direction: **Simplex &rarr; You**  
Transports: **p/REST, MsgQueue**

## Parameters ##

> Example:

```json
{
  "txn_id": "af492cb2-5b07-4318-8ece-be34f479e23b",
  "dst_crypto_addr": "1GzW2M6L54DGMUUv2DTrdPTt8PX6ck5SYp",
  "crypto_currency": "BTC",
  "amount": 125000, // 0.125 BTC
}
```

Name            | Type           | Notes
--------------- | -------------- | -----
txn_id          | Id             |
dst_crypto_addr | CryptoAddr     |
crypto_currency | CryptoCurrency |
amount          | MoneyAmount    |

### txn_id ###
#### (Id, optional)

The identifier of the Simplex transaction involved.

If you the entity that initiated the Simplex transaction then this `txn_id` is known to you, and you can use it for your tracking.

Otherwise, if you did not initiate the Simplex transaction but are rather acting as the liquidity provider/receiver, you can use the `txn_id` to correlate `send-crypto`'s with their corresponding `txn-event-notify`'s, as well as for auditing purposes.

### dst_crypto_addr ###
#### (CryptoAddr, optional)

The destination crypto address to which to send the crypto currency.

### crypto_currency ###
#### (CryptoCurrency, optional)

The type of crypto currencies to send.

### amount ###
#### (MoneyAmount, optional)

The amount of `crypto_currency` to send.

## Response ##

> An example response:

```json
{
  "xo_id": "xo:7791528",
  "status": "completed",
}
```

Your response includes an `xo_id`, which Simplex will later use to query you about the status (in case you respond with a `"pending"` status). Alternatively, you may notify Simplex (using the `xo-status` API) when the status changes from `"pending"` to either `"completed"` or `"failed"`.

Name   | Type   | Notes
------ | ------ | -----
xo_id  | String |
status | String |

### xo_id ###
#### (String)

An opaque string generated by you and stored by Simplex.

You may use this identifier to notify Simplex of the status of the execution order once it changes (e.g. moves from "pending" to "completed"), and Simplex may use this identifier to query you for the status of the execution order.

### status ###
#### (String)

One of { `"completed"`, `"pending"`, `"failed"` }.

## Transports ##

### p/REST ###

<span class="http-verb http-post">POST</span>`https://${YOUR_API_BASE_URL}/send-crypto`

You responsd synchronously, in the body of the POST reply.

### MsgQueue ###

Your response as described above is delivered by `POST /msg/:id/response`.
