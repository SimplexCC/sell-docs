# send-crypto #

An instruction, from Simplex, that you are to send crypto currency to a specified destination crypto address.

If you are the entity providing liquidity for a Simplex transaction, then after Simplex approves that transaction you will be instructed to make blockchain transaction; one that results in the transfer of a specified amount of crypto currency to a specified destination crypto address.

In case of a refund, if you are the entity that received the crypto currency you will be instructed to send it "back" (albeit to a possibly different crypto address from which it was sent).

UUID of the Simplex transaction involved.

Otherwise, if you did not initiate the Simplex transaction but are rather acting the liquidity provider/receiver, you can use this `txn_uuid` to correlate `send-crypto` messages with their corresponding `txn-event-notify` messages, as well as for auditing purposes.

The destination crypto address to which to send the crypto currency.

### currency ###
#### (crypto_currency)

The crypto currency to send.

### amount ###

### status ###

One of { "pending", "failed", "completed" }.

### execution_order_id ###
#### (string)

An opaque string generated by you and stored by Simplex.
