# get-quote #

Convert between crypto and fiat money.

In order for you to provide the "Quote" experience described in the "Flow" section, where users make the decision of how much cryptocurrency they wish to sell, you need to be able to convert back and forth between crypto and fiat money. This is what the `get-quote` API is for.

If this is missing then `quote_amount` is present, and the end-user is asking how many `base_currency` units they need to sell in order to receive `quote_amount` units of `quote_currency`.

### quote_currency ###
