### timestamp ###
#### (Timestamp, **required**)

Timestamp of when the event occurred.

### txn_id ###
#### (Id, **required**)

Identifier of the Simplex transaction.

### event ###
#### (String, **required**)

The type of event that occurred in the transaction.

One of { `"txn-approved"`, `"txn-declined"`, `"txn-refunded"` }.

`"txn-approved"` : The transaction was approved. The end-user's payment method has either been charged (in a BuyCrypto transaction) or credited (in a SellCrypto transaction).

`"txn-declined"` : The transaction was declined, for policy or risk reasons. Simplex does not divulge exact reasons to end-users. No fiat has been charged, and any holds on the end-user's card have been released (some users' banks may take time to reflect that).

`"txn-refunded"` : The transaction has been refunded: fiat money (in a BuyCrypto transaction) or cryptocurrency (in a SellCrypto transaction) has been returned to the end-user.

### quote_id ###
#### (Id, **required**)

Identifier of the quote this transaction is based on.

**Note**: since quotes expires this may change over time for a single transaction. In a `txn-approved` event this is the final, deciding quote.
