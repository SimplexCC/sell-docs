# Introduction #

Welcome to the Simplex API documentation.

The Simplex API enables you to initiate SellCrypto transactions, allowing your end-users to monetize their cryptocurrency and receive fiat money for them. The various API facilities allow you to help your end-users determine how much cryptocurrency they wish to sell, to initiate the transaction and start the checkout flow, to receive notifications on the progress of transactions, and to control source and destination crypto addresses.

The API documentation begins by describing the flow of a SellCrypto transaction, introducing the stages involved. Key concepts in the API are introduced next. The technical part then follows: types, detailed reference for each API, and the protocols involved.
