### txn_id ###
#### (id)

Identifier of the Simplex transaction.

### ts ###
#### (timestamp)

Timestamp of when the event occured.

### event ###
#### (string)

The type of event that occured in the transaction.

One of { `"txn-approved"`, `"txn-declined"`, `"txn-refunded"` }.

 * `"txn-approved"`: The transaction was approved. The end-user's payment method has either been charged (BuyCrypto) or been credited (SellCrypto; though it may take up to 3 days to show on their statement).

 * `"txn-declined"`: The transaction was declined, for policy or risk reasons. Simplex does not divulge exact reasons to end-users. No fiat has been charged, and any holds on the end-user's card have been released (though some of the users' banks may take time to show that).

 * `"txn-refunded"`: The transaction has been refunded. In a BuyCrypto transaction this means the fiat was returned to the end-user, while in a SellCrypto transaction this means the crypto currencies have been returned.

## Response ##

No response is required.
