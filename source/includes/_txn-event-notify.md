The type of event that occurred in the transaction.

One of { `"txn-approved"`, `"txn-declined"`, `"txn-refunded"` }.

`"txn-approved"` : The transaction was approved. The end-user's payment method has either been charged (BuyCrypto) or been credited (SellCrypto; it may take up to 3 days to show on their statement).

`"txn-declined"` : The transaction was declined, for policy or risk reasons. Simplex does not divulge exact reasons to end-users. No fiat has been charged, and any holds on the end-user's card have been released (some users' banks may take time to reflect that).

`"txn-refunded"` : The transaction has been refunded. In a BuyCrypto transaction this means the fiat money was returned to the end-user, while in a SellCrypto transaction this means the cryptocurrency has been returned.
