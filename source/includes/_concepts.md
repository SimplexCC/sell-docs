## Environments ##

Simplex provides a Sandbox environment, which you use while developing and testing your integration. When your testing is complete and you are ready to go live, all you do is switch to the Production environment.

Each environment is accessed with a different URL, and requires a different API key (see below).

## API key ##

As part of your onboarding with Simplex you receive two API keys, which are for authentication. One key is used when running against the Sandbox environment, and the other is used for the Production environment.

## Messages ##
