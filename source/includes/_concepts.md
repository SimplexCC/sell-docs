## Sandbox vs. Production ##

Simplex provides a sandbox environment, which you use while developing and testing your integration. When you are ready to go live, you simply switch to the production environment.

Environments are accessed with different URLs and require different API keys (see below).

## API key ##

As part of your onboarding with Simplex you receive two API keys, which you will use for authentication your API calls. Note that the keys for the sandbox and production environments are different.
