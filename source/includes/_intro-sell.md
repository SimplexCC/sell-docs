# Introduction #

Welcome to the SellCrypto API documentation.

The SellCrypto API makes it possible for you to initiate SellCrypto transactions, thus enabling your users to monetize their crypto currencies and receive fiat money for them. The API further allows you to receive notifications when major events in the transaction lifecycle occur, enabling you to track per-transaction status.

The API documentation starts by describing the flow of a SellCrypto transaction, introducing the stages involved; next, key concepts in using the API are introduced; the technical part then follows: types, detailed reference for each API message, and concluding with the details required for communicating with the API servers.
