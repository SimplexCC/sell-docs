Welcome to the SellCrypto API documentation.

<aside class="notice">
We love hearing from you! If you have ideas on how to make this documentation better, or just more fun, do drop us a line.

The SellCrypto API enables you to initiate SellCrypto transactions, allowing your end-users to monetize their crypto currencies and receive fiat money for them. The various API facilities allow you to help your end-user determine how much crypto currencies they wish to sell; to initiate the transaction and start the checkout flow; to receive notifications on the progress of the transactions; and to control source and destination crypto addresses.

The API documentation begins by describing the flow of a SellCrypto transaction, introducing the stages involved; next, key concepts in using the API are introduced; the technical part then follows: types, detailed reference for each API, and the protocols involved.
