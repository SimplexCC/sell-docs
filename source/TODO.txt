[ TO COMPLETE ]

* complete "transports"
* typos

[ P2 ]

* add screenshots/illustrations to "sell-txn-flow"
* fix "sep" then re-add

[ NOTES FOR DAN ]

* account_details: all keys inside are optional, as well as inside
* don't require E.164 format for phone numbers
* your examples of "US" state is wrong
* renamed fields (source->src, transaction->txn, source->src, address->addr, referer->ref, ...)
* added refund_crypto_addr

[ BETTER API ]

* errors: uniform error response: all responses should have or lack an "_error" field
* errors: define error transport in JWT, REST, P/REST transports
* we should be the ones creating the txn_id, and possibly ask them for their number as well?
* we should be the ones creating the xo_id; we should ask for their number in the response, as optional convenience for them.
* add "serial_num" to payload of notifications (send-coins, txn-event-notify), or even to all, so client can re-order
* timestamp: uniform handling in msgs/transports in order to sequence events
* transport: make same URL for GET and POST in REST; ==> will require auth change
* transport: allow client-only integrations in REST? In JWT? ==> requires _msg to be part of payload as well, so that it's signed

[ BETTER DOC ]

* add actual Transport examples to each API
* more API's
* complete "roles" then re-add
* diff "intro" and "flow" for kyc_broker, lqp, lqr
    * they need to include flow of only events that matter to them
    * they need to include notifications
    * they need to include settlement

* add "FAQ" section
* add diagram to "flow" section

* disable "JSON" examples bar, move examples to main body of text

* param table:
  * move "required" column to be an added word in the 1st col descr
* "address"/"Address" --> "addr"/"Addr"
* "source" --> "src"
* "destination" --> "dst"
* "referrer"/"referer" --> "ref"
* rename types to CamelCase, to diff from param names
* incorporate (TM), "Grog" and "Leather Jackets" jokes
* uniformity in "_id" and "_uuid"
* uniformity in "message" / "call" / "endpoint" / "method" / with-or-without "API" / "api"
* find a way to explain "currency of cryptocurrency"; maybe "currency of crypto coins" or "... of crypto money"?
* find a way to diffrentiate between a "Simplex txn" and a "Blockchain txn" (for e.g. send-crypto)
* find a name for "wallet app / exchange / affiliate / etc."
* change H2 in API chapters to h3, so they don't show up in TOC
* uniformity in "crypto currency" or "... cryptocurrencies" or "crypto currencies"
* fixed-font (``) for "API_STRINGS"
* add internal links

* change to active, rather than passive, voice
* "end-users" ==> "users" where possible
* backtick around all type names and around all parameter names and all api names

[ PREETIFY ]

* add diagrams in "flow"
* add screenshots to "sell flow"
* examples should be inline, not on rhs
* "Required" --> bg-color: hsl(39,88%, 59%); text-shadown 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)

[ BETTER DOC INFRA ]

* switch to flask-pages
* markdown support for admonotion (info, notice, warning, error, success)
* markdown support for generating "required"
* markdown support for "comment" spans (for "optional, string" e.g.)
* support for pre-processing "macros" (BASE_URL, e.g.)
* support TOC with section breaks
* configurable theme
    * syntax highlighting theme
    * base colors only, all the rest with hsl functions in scss
* code-preview pane, with:
    * configurable support for line numbers (yes/no), and whether user can toggle them
    * configurable support for copy-to-clipboard
    * multi languages
    * expand

[ GENERIC DOC ]

* write instructions for how to write doc
	* API's are not "invoked", "called", "methods", "messages", "event" --> they are simply API's
		* this, in order to avoid confusion about messages and return messages in Message Queue transport
		* the plural is API's, not APIs.
    * is this specific to some types of customers?
        * you / your
        * mention the minimum -- KYC's don't care about LQ, or who started the txn
    * is this specific to some product? (buy/sell)
	* crypto currency  --vs--  cryptocurrency  --vs--  crypto currencies  --vs--  cryptocurrencies
* create style guide for each page.
    * what products, and what customer types, is this page for?
    * special considerations when writing documentation in the page -- what we want to tell, what we want to promise, etc.
* define the product types are "Buy", "Sell", and consider "Withdrawal" as possible next
* define the customer types as "KYC vendor", "Wallet / Exchange", "LQP", "LQR", "Affiliate"
* write "intro sell for lqr", "intro sell for kyc", "intro buy", "txn flow buy"
