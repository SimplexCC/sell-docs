[ MUST ]

* same URL for GET and POST in REST? Needs auth change
* allow client-only in REST? In JWT? ==> requires _msg to be part of payload as well

* check for typos
* check for style
* finish "sell-flow"
* fill in "types"

[ PREETIFY ]

* aside -- add "title", right edge finish before example; add narrow vertical line at left edge
* add screenshots to "sell-flow"
* nav -- make current bold
* aside colors -- a little brighter, pastel
* aside -- rounded corners
* REST methods -- pretty GET and POST verbs
* syntax highlighting - diff key/val in json

[ NICE-TO-HAVE ]

* add internal links
* erb variable for base_url

[ BUY SUPPORT ]

* refactor "types" so that it is not sell-specific
* refactor "get-quote" so that it is not sell-specific
* "introduction" --> "intro_sell", and create "intro_buy"
* create "buy_flow"
