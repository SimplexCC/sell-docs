[ TO COMPLETE ]

* txn-event-notify
* initiate-sell
* transports
* txn-flow-sell
* intro-sell
* types

[ MUST ]

* check for typos
* check for style

[ BETTER API ]

* same URL for GET and POST in REST? Needs auth change
* allow client-only in REST? In JWT? ==> requires _msg to be part of payload as well
* maybe WE create the the uuid of the xo?
* add "serial_num" to payload of notifications (send-coins, txn-event-notify), or even to all, so client can re-order

[ BETTER DOC ]

* uniformity in "_id" and "_uuid"
* add "roles" in "concepts", and thus simplify the text is some API messages documentation
* uniformity in "message" / "call" / "endpoint" / "method" / with-or-without "API" / "api"
* find a way to explain "currency of cryptocurrency"; maybe "currency of crypto coins" or "... of crypto money"?
* find a way to diffrentiate between a "Simplex txn" and a "Blockchain txn" (for e.g. send-crypto)
* change H2 in API chapters to h3, so they don't show up in TOC
* uniformity in "crypto currency" or "... cryptocurrencies" or "crypto currencies"
* fixed-font (``) for "API_STRINGS"
* add internal links

[ BETTER DOC INFRA ]

* macros for base_url, etc.
* erb variable for base_url

[ PREETIFY ]

* add screenshots to "sell-flow"
* nicer-looking param tables
* syntax highlighting - diff key/val in json
* "Required" --> bg-color: hsl(39,88%, 59%); text-shadown 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)

[ BUY SUPPORT ]

* refactor "types" so that it is not sell-specific
* refactor "get-quote" so that it is not sell-specific
* "introduction" --> "intro_sell", and create "intro_buy"
* create "buy_flow"
