[ MUST ]

* same URL for GET and POST in REST? Needs auth change
* allow client-only in REST? In JWT? ==> requires _msg to be part of payload as well
* maybe we should decide on the uuid of the xo?
* uniformity in "_id" and "_uuid"

* check for typos
* check for style

[ PREETIFY ]

* add screenshots to "sell-flow"
* aside -- add "title"
* syntax highlighting - diff key/val in json
* "Required" --> bg-color: hsl(39,88%, 59%); text-shadown 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)

[ NICE-TO-HAVE ]

* add internal links
* erb variable for base_url

[ BUY SUPPORT ]

* refactor "types" so that it is not sell-specific
* refactor "get-quote" so that it is not sell-specific
