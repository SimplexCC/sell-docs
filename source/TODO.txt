[ TO COMPLETE ]

* txn-flow-sell
* concepts
* initiate-sell params
* fill in missing details in "Transpots" sections of all pages
* transports

* check for typos
* check for style

[ P2 ]

* discuss refund in flow
* add screenshots/illustrations to "sell-txn-flow"
* fix "sep" then re-add
* complete "roles" then re-add
* diff "intro" and "flow" for kyc_broker, lqp, lqr
    * they need to include flow of only events that matter to them
    * they need to include notifications
    * they need to include settlement

[ NOTES FOR DAN ]

* account_details: all keys inside are optional, as well as inside
* don't require E.164 format for phone numbers
* your examples of "US" state is wrong
* renamed fields (source->src, transaction->txn, source->src, address->addr, referer->ref, ...)
* rename address_line_1 to line1 etc
* refund_addr

[ BETTER API ]

* maybe WE should be the ones creating the txn_id, and simply ask them for their number as well?
* maybe WE create the the uuid of the xo?
* same URL for GET and POST in REST? Needs auth change
* allow client-only in REST? In JWT? ==> requires _msg to be part of payload as well
* add "serial_num" to payload of notifications (send-coins, txn-event-notify), or even to all, so client can re-order

[ BETTER DOC ]

* param table:
  * move "required" column to be an added word in the 1st col descr
* "address"/"Address" --> "addr"/"Addr"
* "source" --> "src"
* "destination" --> "dst"
* "referrer"/"referer" --> "ref"
* rename types to CamelCase, to diff from param names
* incorporate (TM), "Grog" and "Leather Jackets" jokes
* uniformity in "_id" and "_uuid"
* uniformity in "message" / "call" / "endpoint" / "method" / with-or-without "API" / "api"
* find a way to explain "currency of cryptocurrency"; maybe "currency of crypto coins" or "... of crypto money"?
* find a way to diffrentiate between a "Simplex txn" and a "Blockchain txn" (for e.g. send-crypto)
* find a name for "wallet app / exchange / affiliate / etc."
* change H2 in API chapters to h3, so they don't show up in TOC
* uniformity in "crypto currency" or "... cryptocurrencies" or "crypto currencies"
* fixed-font (``) for "API_STRINGS"
* add internal links

[ BETTER DOC INFRA ]

* macros for base_url, etc.
* erb variable for base_url

[ PREETIFY ]

* Examples should be inline mostly, not on right (?)
* add screenshots to "sell-flow"
* "Required" --> bg-color: hsl(39,88%, 59%); text-shadown 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)

[ BUY SUPPORT ]

* refactor "types" so that it is not sell-specific
* refactor "get-quote" so that it is not sell-specific
* "introduction" --> "intro_sell", and create "intro_buy"
* create "buy_flow"
